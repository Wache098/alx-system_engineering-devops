Steps for Debugging the LAMP Stack with WordPress
Check the Web Server (Apache) Logs:

Apache logs can often give insights into what's going wrong. These logs are typically located at:
Error log: /var/log/apache2/error.log
Access log: /var/log/apache2/access.log
Check for any unusual error messages or HTTP status codes.
Enable Detailed Error Reporting in PHP:

By default, PHP might not show detailed errors on the web pages. You can enable detailed error reporting by modifying the php.ini file or adding the following lines to your WordPress wp-config.php file:
php
Copy code
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', true);
This will log errors to a file (debug.log) inside the wp-content directory, and display errors on the web page.
Check PHP Configuration:

Review your PHP configuration file (php.ini) to ensure it's properly set up, particularly the error logging settings.
Location of php.ini: /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini (on Ubuntu 14.04).
You might want to increase memory_limit, max_execution_time, or enable display_errors for debugging.
Inspect MySQL:

Make sure the MySQL server is running and accessible. Check MySQL logs typically located at /var/log/mysql/error.log.
Verify that WordPress can connect to the database by checking the DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_HOST settings in the wp-config.php file.
You can also log into MySQL using the credentials from wp-config.php to verify the database is working as expected.
Check Apache Configuration:

Ensure that Apache is correctly configured to serve WordPress. This involves checking the virtual host configuration files usually found in /etc/apache2/sites-available/.
Look for any misconfigurations, such as incorrect DocumentRoot, directory permissions, or missing modules.
Puppet Manifest Requirements:

Since you're working with Puppet, ensure that your manifests are clean and follow the guidelines provided:
Start with a comment explaining what the manifest does.
Ensure all your manifests pass puppet-lint without any errors.
Test your manifests to make sure they apply cleanly on a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system.
Remember to name your files with the .pp extension and ensure they adhere to best practices in Puppet coding.
Final Check and Validation:

After making changes, restart Apache (sudo service apache2 restart) and see if the issue persists.
Use tools like curl, wget, or directly accessing the site in a browser to verify that it is responding correctly.
Recheck logs after changes to confirm that issues are resolved.
