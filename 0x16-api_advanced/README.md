Authentication: Identify how to authenticate your requests. Look for sections on API keys, OAuth, or other authentication mechanisms. This is usually near the start of the documentation.

Endpoints Section: This is where you'll find the different actions you can perform with the API (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each endpoint typically has:

URL: The specific path to the resource.
HTTP Method: The action to be performed (e.g., GET for reading data, POST for creating data).
Parameters: Input parameters that can be passed with the request. These can be in the query string, headers, or body.
Responses: Examples of successful and unsuccessful responses, usually with example JSON or XML formats.
Error Codes: A list of possible error responses with explanations.
Search & Index: Use the search function or index provided in the documentation to quickly find relevant endpoints based on keywords.

Examples: Look for code examples that show how to use the API. These are often provided in multiple programming languages.

Rate Limiting & Quotas: Be aware of any rate limits or quotas to avoid getting your requests blocked.

Versioning: Check if the API is versioned, and make sure you're using the correct version.

How to Use an API with Pagination
APIs often paginate results to avoid sending too much data in a single response. Here's how to handle it:

Identify Pagination Parameters: Check the API documentation for parameters like page, limit, offset, next, or previous.

Initial Request: Make the initial API request with default or specified pagination parameters.

Handling the Response:

Extract the data from the response.
Check if there are more pages of data (usually indicated by a next or hasMore field in the response).
Subsequent Requests: If there are more pages, make additional requests using updated pagination parameters (e.g., increment the page number or update the offset).

Loop Until Complete: Continue making requests until all pages have been retrieved.
