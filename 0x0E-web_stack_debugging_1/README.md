Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving issues within the layers of a web application stack. Here are the key components:

Web Server Configuration:

Ensure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) is correctly configured to listen on the appropriate ports and addresses.
Verify that the configuration files do not contain syntax errors or misconfigurations.
Application Server:

Check that the application server (e.g., Gunicorn, Node.js) is running and correctly connected to the web server.
Review logs for any runtime errors or issues.
Database:

Ensure the database server is running and accessible from the application server.
Verify database credentials and connection strings.
Network Issues:

Check network configurations, such as firewall rules and security groups, to ensure traffic can flow between components.
Use tools like curl, ping, and telnet to diagnose connectivity issues.
Logs and Monitoring:

Examine logs from the web server, application server, and database for errors or warnings.
Implement monitoring tools to detect and alert on issues in real-time.
System Resources:

Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to ensure the server is not resource-constrained.
Use tools like top, htop, and df to monitor resource usage.
Network Basics
Understanding basic networking concepts is crucial for web stack debugging and ensuring smooth communication between components. Key concepts include:

IP Addressing:

Each device on a network has a unique IP address. IPv4 addresses are in the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.
Private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) are used within private networks, while public IP addresses are used on the internet.
Ports:

Ports are numerical identifiers in TCP/UDP protocols that direct traffic to specific services on a device (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
Ensure the correct ports are open and listening for incoming traffic.
DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses.
Ensure DNS records are correctly configured for your domains.
Firewalls and Security Groups:

Firewalls control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.
Security groups are similar to firewalls but are specific to cloud environments (e.g., AWS).
Network Protocols:

Common protocols include HTTP/HTTPS for web traffic, SSH for secure shell access, and FTP/SFTP for file transfers.
Ensure the appropriate protocols are used and configured correctly.
Network Tools:

ping: Tests connectivity between devices.
traceroute: Traces the path packets take to reach a destination.
netstat: Displays network connections and listening ports.
curl: Transfers data from or to a server, useful for testing web server responses.
By understanding these basics and applying them during debugging, you can effectively identify and resolve issues within the web stack and network, ensuring your web applications run smoothly.
