0x0A. Configuration management
1. Configuration Management
Configuration management involves maintaining consistency of a productâ€™s performance by tracking and managing changes. It ensures that systems perform as expected after modifications. Key tools and concepts include:

Tools: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, SaltStack
Concepts:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure using machine-readable definition files.
Version Control: Keeping track of configuration changes over time using systems like Git.
Automation: Reducing manual intervention through automated scripts and tools.
2. DevOps
DevOps combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. Key components include:

Continuous Integration (CI): Frequently merging code changes into a central repository and automatically running tests.
Continuous Delivery (CD): Ensuring code changes are automatically prepared for release to production.
Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploying every change that passes automated tests to production.
Collaboration Tools: Slack, Microsoft Teams, and collaborative platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
3. SysAdmin
System Administration involves managing and maintaining computer systems, servers, and networks. Key tasks include:

Monitoring: Using tools like Nagios, Zabbix, and Prometheus to monitor system health and performance.
Backup and Recovery: Implementing backup solutions and disaster recovery plans.
Security: Ensuring systems are secure through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular updates.
User Management: Handling user accounts, permissions, and authentication.
4. Scripting
Scripting involves writing small programs to automate tasks. Common scripting languages include:

Bash: Used primarily in Unix and Linux environments.
Python: Widely used for its readability and extensive libraries.
PowerShell: Used in Windows environments for task automation and configuration management.
5. CI/CD
CI/CD practices aim to improve the process of software development by automating integration and delivery. Key tools and practices include:

CI Tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI
CD Tools: Spinnaker, Argo CD, AWS CodePipeline
Pipeline as Code: Defining CI/CD pipelines in code, often using YAML files.
Testing: Automating unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality.


I'm using puppet in this case
